A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

-Built a space where sharing thoughts is 100% judgment-free. 💬

Excited to share my latest personal project: AnonCA (Anonymous Chat Application)!

In a world where online identity often comes with pressure, I built AnonCA as a truly anonymous global group chat. People can join and share their thoughts, ideas, and feelings without the fear of being recognized.

Key Features:

Total Anonymity: Identity is abstracted, focusing the conversation on content, not credentials.

Real-Time Global Chat: Instant updates powered by Firestore Streams.

Clean, Dark UI: Custom theming with a deep purplish-blue background for a modern feel.

Tech Stack Highlights:

Built using Flutter for a beautiful cross-platform UI.

Backend handled by Firebase Authentication & Cloud Firestore.
